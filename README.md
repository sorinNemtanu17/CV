# Final Project 1 - Online CV

Create an online CV page to get your new IT career started. Make sure that it has the following features:

- It has at least the following pages (you may of course include the rest any others even those you crated for other homework):
  - “Home” / “About Me” - add a photo of you, and a few words about yourself. Include the “front-end development” part
  - “My Online CV” - think about a format for your CV and start writing it in an HTML page.
  - “Show Off Page(s) :D” / “Personal” / “Hobbies” / “Technical” / etc - use this to show off some of the technical things that you’ve learned and are proud of (we will have a number of projects you can showcase here later on)
- It has a way of navigating between the pages (a menu present on all pages)
- It is responsive
- Don't use external CSS libraries except for: fonts, icon fonts; no Bootstrap or Material UI

## Process

- Define tasks for yourself
- Prioritize them
- Keep track of your work using those tasks

## Generic Tasks

1. Get inspired by what others do
2. Define website structure
   1. Pages
   2. Navigation between them
   3. Common areas
   4. How to have only one (html) file for the header/footer/menu and load it in all three pages? (You could use iframe or AJAX (we'll get to this later))
3. Define & implement header & footer
4. Define HTML content for all pages
5. Define breakpoints (at least for testing)
6. Style each page

## Keep in mind!

- Keep it simple
- Make it work, then make it better (then make it beautiful 😊)
- Aim to have a great usability and accessibility
